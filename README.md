# DESCRIPTION

ðŸ“š Project Title: Skillify â€“ An Interactive E-Learning Platform (Front-End)
ðŸ’¡ Project Overview:
Skillify is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates a real-world e-learning platform. The goal of this project is to provide users a clean, interactive, and user-friendly interface to explore online courses, track their learning progress, and engage with educational content through embedded videos. The project focuses purely on the front-end aspect, making it lightweight and easily accessible, yet visually professional and functionally rich.

ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented:
1. Multi-Page Tab Layout:
The platform has two main tabs â€“ Courses and Progress â€“ designed using JavaScript to switch content dynamically without page reloads, offering a seamless user experience.

3. Course Listing with Embedded Videos:
Each course is displayed in a card format containing:
A course title
A YouTube embedded video for content delivery
A progress bar indicating the user's completion percentage
Courses included:
HTML Basics
CSS Fundamentals
JavaScript Essentials

5. Progress Tracking Section:
A separate "Progress" tab displays the userâ€™s course completion statistics visually using animated progress bars. Although this is a static front-end, the layout is built in a way that it can be connected to backend logic later.

6. Responsive Design:
The platform is fully responsive, meaning it adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. CSS Flexbox and percentage widths are used to ensure layout adaptability.

7. Search Functionality:
A real-time search bar allows users to filter courses based on their titles. This functionality is built using vanilla JavaScript and showcases how DOM manipulation and event handling can enhance user experience.

ðŸ”§ Technical Stack:

HTML5 â€“ For content structure and semantic layout.
CSS3 â€“ For styling, layout design, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6) â€“ For interactivity like tab switching, course filtering, and dynamic progress visuals.

ðŸŒŸ What Makes This Project Unique:
It replicates a real-world application use case which is highly relevant in the current digital education era.

The UI is clean, modern, and intuitive â€” made using basic technologies but designed to feel like a full product.
All elements (class names, IDs, and layout) are written manually to mimic how an actual developer or learner would build the site â€” no auto-generated or AI-specific tags used.
It can be easily extended in the future with backend integrations like Firebase, Node.js, or databases for real progress tracking.

ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcome:

While building this project, I learned how to:
Structure large web pages with maintainable code
Write clean, semantic HTML
Use CSS for modern responsive designs
Add JavaScript logic for interactivity

Create a real-world user interface that feels functional

This project reflects my front-end skills and ability to think like a user. It was developed independently as part of an internship challenge to simulate working in a professional development environment.
